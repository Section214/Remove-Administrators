Allows admins to hide the admin role from all other roles.

== Description ==

Do you develop websites for a living? Do you prefer to give your clients a level of access other than Administrator to prevent accidental damage? Maybe even a custom role? What if you wanted to hide the Admin user(s) from them altogether? This plugin does exactly that!

Currently based off the 'update_core' permission, Remove Administrators hides all references to Admins from all other user roles on the dashboard. The next release will support configurable permissions and multisite installations.
